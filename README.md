# CMSC424-Project

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate a database system that supports a Story Notification System (SNS).

The SNS allows the users to receive, in real time, messages like news, alerts and other notifications from a central database server. The messages are classified into several categories like news, alerts, announcements, notifications and other user-defined categories. The content of each message is Multi-Media; that is, text, one or more images, and audio files. The messages in each of these categories have both temporal duration and spatial locality; that is, they are active for an assigned begin and end time and are pertinent to a specific location. Active messages are targeted to users who register to receive messages in some of these categories and are within the location range of the message. For example, a user who has registered to receive weather NOAA alerts, will receive those that are active and pertinent to her location.
